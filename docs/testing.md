The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is calculated using the following formula:

r = (Σ(x_i - x̄)(y_i - ȳ)) / √((Σ(x_i - x̄)^2)(Σ(y_i - ȳ)^2))

Where:
- `r` is the correlation coefficient
- `x_i` and `y_i` are the individual data points for variables x and y, respectively
- `x̄` and `ȳ` are the means of the x and y variables, respectively
- `Σ` denotes the sum of the values

The value of `r` ranges from -1 to 1, where:
- `r = 1` indicates a perfect positive linear relationship
- `r = -1` indicates a perfect negative linear relationship
- `r = 0` indicates no linear relationship
