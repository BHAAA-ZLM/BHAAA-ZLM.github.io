My major is Bioinformatics. So most of my work, of course, is related to biology. I have an interesting story about choosing biology as my major. In the freshman year, I chose the course *Introduction to Life Science* at first. Since I'm not that interested in biology at that moment, I didn't choose the required course *Principle of Biology*. But in the first class, the professor told all of us, "Don't expect to learn anything new in *Introduction to Life Science*!". And I was like," Whaaat? Then what am I choosing this class for?" So after the first class I changed to *Principle of Biology* and met three wonderful teachers [Prof. Chen Wei](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/chenwei.html), [Prof. Xiao Bo](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/xiaobo.html), and [Prof. Guo Hongwei](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/guo-hongwei.html). They ignited my passion towards biology, and I decided to major in biology. (And because I want to learn some math and computer science, I finally chose bioinformatics.)
