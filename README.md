## Introduction
After discussing questions about studying aboard with Professor Chen Xi, I decided to open up my own blog through GitHub Pages. So I build this repository where I will share interesting life experiences and knowledge I learnt in school.

Link to the blog is [here](https://bhaaa-zlm.github.io/) and everyone is welcome to give advices in discussion.

## About Me
Hi! My name is Lumi. The name came from my Chinese name Luming. I am currently a student in [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn), majoring in Bioinformatics. I'm very interested in biology and computer science, that's the main reason I chose this major.

## About the Blog
Current thoughts are about sharing my life experiences in SUSTech, recording the experiments I did in the school, and some new knowledge I found very interesting. I might add new things to the blog, but I will try my best to keep these three blogs up-to-date.
